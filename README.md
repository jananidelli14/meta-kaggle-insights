# 🧠 Cracking Kaggle: Evolution of Competition Trends

### 🔍 Exploring how Kaggle has evolved through users, kernels, and competitions

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Meta Kaggle Hackathon** to analyze and uncover insights from Kaggle’s internal dataset.  
Using the `Meta-Kaggle` datasets, I explored trends in competitions, user activity, kernel (notebook) creation, forum discussions, medal growth, and dataset popularity.  
The goal is to understand how Kaggle has evolved and what patterns emerge among top contributors.
