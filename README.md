🧠 Cracking Kaggle: Evolution of Competition Trends
🔍 Exploring how Kaggle has evolved through users, kernels, and competitions
📌 Project Overview
This project was developed for the Meta Kaggle Hackathon. Using multiple datasets from Kaggle’s internal Meta-Kaggle dataset, I explored how the platform has grown over time — analyzing competition types, user behavior, kernel trends, medals, and community engagement.
